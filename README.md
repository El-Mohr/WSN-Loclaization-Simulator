# WSN-Loclaization-Simulator
Wireless sensor network localization environment using Python


## WSN_Sim:
Build a WSN environment of arbitrary number of anchors and nodes, and based on their positions the tool simulates the sensors and estimates Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI), Angle of Arrival (AoA) and Time of Arrival (ToA) with added noise being considered.


## Triangulation AoA:
Uses the raw data provided by WSN_sim with added noise and provides localization estimations using triangulation on AoA


## Trilateration ToA:
Uses the raw data provided by WSN_sim with added noise and provides localization estimations using trilateration on ToA


## Trilateration RSSI:
Uses the raw data provided by WSN_sim with added noise and provides localization estimations using trilateration on RSSI
